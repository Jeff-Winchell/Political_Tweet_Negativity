Before you can download your own data, you need to get a Twitter Developer account (it is free unless you want some special features I am not using)

Official documentation is here:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started
Scroll down to get to the section (How to get started with the Twitter APIs) which will take some time for Twitter to approve your access.

Or Google Twitter API getting started or tutorial to find something more useful to you.

Once you get your Twitter API going, you need to edit the file 
Twitter_Account_List.r
to put in the key(s) you get from your approved Twitter developer account.
