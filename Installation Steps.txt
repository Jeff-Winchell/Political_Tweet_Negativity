Before you can download your own data, you need to get a Twitter Developer account (it is free unless you want some special features I am not using)

Official documentation is here:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started
Scroll down to get to the section (How to get started with the Twitter APIs) which will take some time for Twitter to approve your access.

Or Google Twitter API getting started or tutorial to find something more useful to you.

Once you get your Twitter API going, you need to edit the file 
Twitter_Account_List.r
to put in the key(s) you get from your approved Twitter developer account.

Copy all files from this repository to some subdirectory on your computer

While waiting for Twitter to get you access to its API, you can do the rest of the install.

Install SQL Server 2019 for Windows (The Developer's Edition is free if you use it personally, not commercially). There is a LINUX edition. I don't know LINUX so you will need to get help from others where it differs from the Windows version.

SQL Install Instructions TBA

Once you have SQL Server installed and configured, you can run the DDL.sql file within SQL Server to create the empty database, optimizations and custom programs stored in the database. Change the name of the database in the top dozen or so lines if you want the database name to be different.

At this point you need Twitter API working. So don't continue here until that is done.

Then using R, run Get_Politicians.r to query Twitter to give you basic information about the politicians (whose followers you want to analyze). Adjust this file if you have changed the default database name.
A list of politicians twitter accounts is already included. Adjust it to fit your interests.

On SQL Server, run Update_Politician_Names.sql to assign a name for each candidate (necessary in your analysis because some politicians may have multiple twitter accounts and you can't be sure if their fans follow one or all of those accounts).
